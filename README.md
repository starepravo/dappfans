DappFans is the source code made on 9th BlockhainUA Hackathon to proof the concept of NFT use for DApp application that resembles the model of OnlyFans.com site. This is aimed with extension of base ERC721 standard with couple of media specific use cases, such as:
* Alice releases own creative work to NFT platform 
* Bob purchases NFT right for access Alice’s work for cryptocurrency
* Platform maintains rating for Alice and Bob based on purchase amounts and # transactions and satisfaction rate
* Charlie purchases NFTs from Alice, repack it in bundle and sell to Bob
* Charlie purchase NFT “futures” from Alice at the fixed price per item 
* Mike attempts to sell/publish non-genuine/existing NFT prevented by platform 
* Mike’s attempt to access NFT item that was not purchased by him blocked by platform
